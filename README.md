### Based on the above chart we can say:
1- Urban cities have the most ride-sharing amount among the Suburban and Rural cities.
2- The lowest ride-sharing amount belongs to Rural cities.
3- Peak of ride -sharing time in urban cities is on March.


## Summary
- below three points need to consider in order to improve the efficiency of the service:
  - Need to reallocate the resouces in peak time for urban cities to be able for getting more ride request
  - Hiring seasonal employees as driver for peak time in urban cities
  - In suburban cities define some promotional program for January and Mid of March which are the lowest demand time of the year to get more service request.
